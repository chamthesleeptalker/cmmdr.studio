            Last July, we invited 97 students of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and Bachelor of Science in Education of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines - Bansud, Oriental Mindoro Campus to join us in a Make the Map Ausome Event.

          As part of the program, they learned about open mapping, open data, and OpenStreetMap through an introduction by Ian Panganiban, Ausome Maps’ Technical Consultant.

          They determined which are the ‘Myths and the Facts’ about the autism spectrum disorder through an interactive presentation by Charlyne Mamador, aspiring developmental pediatrician and a 2nd year medicine student at the Cavite State University. In this session, we also asked the future educators and innovators on how they can make their immediate community more inclusive.

          We also discussed how we are creating the platform – TherapEase. Deinyel Matira, an incoming senior BS Computer Science student at the University of the Philippines Diliman and Ausome Maps’ software development intern shared about the steps that a development project follows from user research, solution design, development, and continuous product iteration from user feedback.
